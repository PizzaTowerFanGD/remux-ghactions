# Why this exists
GitHub has free server load (up to 6h, unlimited on public repos), and it works surprisingly well for remuxing (pretty much just fixing) videos with ffmpeg!
(Actually the reason is that my device is dogshit)
# How to use this
1. Fork the repo, keep it public.
2. Go to Actions, then enable them.
3. Upload your file to a file-host. I recommend [https://catbox.moe](Catbox) for permanent uploads up to 200MB. If you don't want your files to be kept around, or your file is up to 1GB, I also recommend [https://litterbox.catbox.moe/](Litterbox). Both are anonymous entirely.
4. Run the action, pasting the URL provided by your selected host, and selecting a file name.
5. When it's finished (usually around a minute or two), go to the Job linked.
6. Scroll down, then just click on the file.
7. Unzip and enjoy.

Nah, just kidding. I haven't been asked about this yet.
